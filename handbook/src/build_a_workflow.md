# How to Build a Workflow

> [!NOTE]
> This chapter will be about building workflows using the **native Rust API**. That
> means writing Rust code to build the workflow, which will be compiled and embeded
> in an application. If you are instead interested in building workflows using
> **JSON diagrams**, then you can skip ahead to the [JSON Diagrams](./json_diagrams.md)
> chapter.
