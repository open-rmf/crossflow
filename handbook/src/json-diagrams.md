# JSON Diagrams

The [Rust API for building workflows](./spawn-workflows.md) is a good choice for embedding workflows natively into applications, especially [Bevy](https://bevy.org/)-based applications.
The Rust compiler will do a lot of heavy lifting to ensure the connections between your operations are compatible and that your workflow is being built correctly.

Another powerful feature of crossflow is to dynamically build an executable workflow from a JSON [Diagram] at runtime.
These JSON diagrams can be hand-written by GUI tools or generated by automatic planners.
Then the diagrams can be sent to an executor to be run.

This chapter will explain the syntax of Crossflow JSON Diagrams and how to put together an executor.

To enable the diagram feature, remember to enable the `diagram` feature of crossflow:

```toml
# Cargo.toml

[dependencies]
crossflow = { version = "*", features = ["diagram"] }
```
